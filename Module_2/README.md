# Module 2 - Programming and Python

Now we're gonna get in to "real" programming! This is going to be the most expansive part of this project, so take your time and feel free to ask questions. As usual you don't *need* to push your code changes to GH, but I do recommend doing so and asking for review. This will allow me to provide feedback and help point out best practices and other things of note.

There are a lot (and I mean **a lot**) of programming resources out there. As such I'm going to spend less time teaching the basics, and instead direct you on the concepts you should be learning.
