# Module 2 - Programming and Python

Now we're gonna get in to "real" programming! This is going to be the most expansive part of this project, so take your time and feel free to ask questions. As usual you don't *need* to push your code changes to GH, but I do recommend doing so and asking for review. This will allow me to provide feedback and help point out best practices and other things of note.

There are a lot (and I mean **a lot**) of programming resources out there. As such I'm going to spend less time teaching the basics, and instead direct you on the concepts you should be learning.

To get started I recommend checking out the [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_getting_started) and [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/faq) subreddits. I actually originally learned how to program via Reddit before going to community college, and their resources have expanded a lot over the years. [RealPython.com](https://realpython.com) is also a good place to get started. 

## Why Python?

As I mentioned in Module 1, people usually wonder "what's the best programming language to learn?" and as a result they end up getting stuck, or jump around a lot while learning. The truth is that every language is good at certain *types* of programming, but there isn't a "best language". I've chosen to use Python for this project for a few reasons...

* The syntax (basically the "rules" of how a language is written and read) is pretty simple. Rather than relying on commas and semicolons and brackets/braces it uses whitespace (spaces and tabs).
* It has a lot of different uses. Whatever type of work you end up doing, you'll eventually end up working with it at some point.
* It's a scripting language (more on that later)
* It's the language I've used the most, so it's easier for me teach.
* It's the first language I learned, so it's got a special place in my heart. :p

In the end, all the concepts I'm exploring in this project will translate directly to other languages. The reality is that once you've "learned programming" you can learn to program in a different language very easily. When I started with my current job I had to learn a language called Groovy. I had never even heard about it, but it only took me a day or two to learn the basics. Don't get hung up on what language you decide to work with.

## Programming vs Scripting vs Software Engineering

Theres an important distinction I want to make. There are a lot of different terms thrown around with coding, like "programming", "scripting", and "software engineering". Most of the time these terms are used interchangeably, but there are some nuances between them worth noting.

**Programming and coding** typically refer to the actual act of writing code to accomplish various tasks. These are the kinds of "catch all" terms used for everything from writing code in HTML and CSS, all the way to using Assembly.

**Software engineering** (sometimes abbreviated to SE or SWE) encompasses more "intensive" programming, where you're doing some deep level work. Languages involved in this kind of coding often have a higher learning curve because they work to provide the programmer with fine control over things like RAM and CPU useage. Things like the OS, video games, and other fully fledged applications that you can download and install are typically included in this category. Some languages used in this include C, C++, Assembly (which is basically one step above literally binary), and Java. 

**Scripting** is a term used to describe the type of programming you would do to accomplish one specific type of task. Rather than having to worry about the fine details (freeing up RAM, compiling the code, etc) all you care about is getting from point A to point B. Languages tailored for scripting (like Python, Lua, and Groovy) work to take care of the overhead for you. Things like this tend to be self contained scripts and libraries the exist to automate or help with specific jobs, like managing a cluster of servers or parsing through log files and other data.

This project focuses on **scripting**, rather than software engineering. You need to learn to walk before you run, and the same goes for those two disciplines. That's in no way to say that scripting is less important than software engineering, they're just meant for different things. If software engineering is something you'd like to eventually do, know that scripting isn't a useless thing to learn. It's still something you'll work with nearly daily, and the principles behind the two are the same. One is just more in depth than the other.
